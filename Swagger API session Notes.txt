Swagger

Swagger is an open-source framework for designing and describing APIs. 
Swagger’s journey started in 2010.
It was developed by Reverb Technologies.  
To solve the need for keeping the API design and documentation in sync. 
Swagger has become the de-facto standard for designing and describing 
RESTful APIs 
It is used by millions of developers and organizations for developing 
their APIs.
It can be for internal or client facing.

Why Swagger?

Design and document APIs simultaneously, thus keeping the blueprint 
and documentation in sync.

Both human and machine readable, with an interactive API documentation 
automatically generated to see the API in action.

Large comprehensive tooling ecosystem around the framework, which lets us 
go beyond just design, from SDK generation to testing and debugging.

Strong open source community supporting and spearheading the framework.


Creating an API
The Swagger definition of an API can be 
divided into 3 different sections –

1) The Meta Information
2) The Path Items:
3) Reusable components:

Swagger UI provides a display framework that reads an OpenAPI 
specification document and generates an interactive documentation 
website.
